The Guessing Number Game is a simple game where the computer randomly selects a number within a specific range, and the player has to guess that number. Here's how it works, explained step by step:

1.*How the Game Works:*
Computer Chooses a Number:

The computer selects a random number within a specific range. For example, it could pick a number between 1 and 100.
Player Makes a Guess:

The player (you) tries to guess the number the computer has picked.
You enter your guess into the game.
Feedback is Given:

After you guess, the game will tell you if your guess is:
Too low (the number is higher).
Too high (the number is lower).
Correct (you guessed the right number).
Keep Guessing:

You keep guessing, and the game keeps providing feedback until you guess the correct number.
After each guess, you know whether to guess higher or lower.
Win the Game:

The game ends when you guess the correct number.
It will then tell you how many attempts it took for you to guess the number.

2.*Example of How It Plays:*
The computer picks a random number between 1 and 200 (let’s say it's 42).
You guess 50.
The game says, "Too high! Try again."
You guess 30.
The game says, "Too low! Try again."
You guess 42.
The game says, "Correct! You've guessed the number in 3 attempts."

3.*Why It’s Fun:*
The game is a fun way to practice problem-solving, especially with trying to narrow down the number using feedback (too high, too low).
Each time you play, the number is random, so it's different every time.
